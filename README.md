# Data Structures in PHP

## Description
This project aims to implement various data structures using PHP.  <br>
The goal is to provide PHP implementations for commonly used data structures, such as stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and graphs, to enhance understanding and practical usage of these fundamental concepts.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-structures-php.git

## Usage
To use the implemented data structures, you can include the respective PHP files in your project and instantiate the classes. <br>
For example, to use the Stack implementation:

require_once 'Stack.php'; // Adjust the path as needed <br>

$stack = new Car(); <br>
$stack->push(9); <br>
$stack->push(3); <br>
$stack->display(); <br>
$stack->push(5); <br>
$stack->display(); <br>
$stack->pop(); <br>
$stack->display(); <br>
$stack->peek(); <br>
